    <h2>Follow the steps!</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Step 1</li>
      <p>For marinade: In a large bowl, 
      combine the wine, cognac, onions, 
      carrots, parsley, bay leaf, garlic, 
      peppercorns and salt.  Mix well and add 
      the cubed beef. Cover and marinate in 
      the refrigerator for 2 days.</p>

      <li>Step 2</li>
      <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F 
      (150 degrees C).</p>

      <li>Step 3</li>
      <p>For Bourguignon: Strain the meat from 
      the vegetables and marinade; reserve 
      marinade. Dry meat with paper towels. 
      Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large 
      skillet over medium high heat. 
      Add the meat and saute for 10 minutes, 
      or until browned on all sides. 
      Transfer meat to a separate medium bowl 
      with a slotted spoon and set aside.</p>

      <li>Step 4</li>
      <p>In the same skillet, add the bacon and 
      saute until lightly browned. Transfer 
      the bacon to the bowl with the meat. 
      Drain the skillet and return it to the 
      heat. Pour a cup of marinade into the 
      skillet to deglaze the skillet, scraping 
      the bottom to loosen up all the little 
      bits. Return this liquid to the reserved 
      marinade.</p>

      <li>Step 5</li>
      <p>Heat the remaining oil in the skillet. 
      Add the onion and carrot from the marinade,
      along with the additional onion that you've
      chopped, and saute for 5 minutes, or until
      tender. Transfer this mixture to the bowl
      with the meat and bacon, again using a
      slotted spoon, and return skillet to the
      heat. Add the flour to the skillet,
      combining with the oil and stir until well
      mixed and brown, about 2 minutes.</p>

      <li>Step 6</li>
      <p>Now add the tomato paste, garlic, beef
      broth, reserved marinade and salt and
      pepper to taste. Bring to a boil and
      whisk to remove any flour lumps.
      Add this to the meat and vegetable mixture.
      Place entire mixture into a 9x13 baking dish.</p>

      <li>Step 7</li>
      <p>Bake at 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) 
      for 3 hours, stirring occasionally and
      adding water as needed. Season with salt
      and pepper to taste.</p>

      <li>Step 8</li>
      <p>About 15 minutes before meat is done
        baking, melt butter in the skillet over
        medium high heat. Add the mushrooms and
        saute for 5 to 10 minutes, or until
        lightly browned. When meat is done, add
        the mushrooms to the meat mixture, stir
        well and let sit for about 15 minutes.</p>
