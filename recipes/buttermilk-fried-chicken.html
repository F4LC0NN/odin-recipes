  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p>Fried chicken, also known as 
  <em>Southern fried chicken</em> is a dish 
  consisting of chicken pieces that have 
  been coated with <strong>seasoned flour</strong>
  or <strong>batter</strong> and pan-fried, deep fried,
  pressure fried, or air fried. The breading
  adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of
  the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. 
  Broiler chickens are most commonly used.</p>

  <ol id="steps">
    <li>Step 1</li>
    <p>Wash chicken and pat dry. In a large bowl,
    stir together buttermilk, garlic powder,
    onion powder, poultry seasoning and celery
    seeds. Place chicken in buttermilk mixture
    and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.</p>

    <li>Step 2</li>
    <p>In a large frying pan or wok, heat oil to 
    325 degrees F. Drain chicken in a colander to
    remove excess buttermilk. Place tempura batter
    mix in a large paper bag; add chicken. 
    Close top and gently shake bag to coat chicken
    with tempura batter mix. Remove chicken and
    fry, turning pieces over after 3 minutes.
    Continue to fry, turning occasionally, until
    browned on all sides.</p>
